Project for CS1D European Vacation

CS1D Project 1 European Vacation
Style Guide:
In general make the code:

Readability
Reusability
Modifiability
Easy to debug
Name identifiers properly, ex: variables: lowerCamelCase; constants: UPPER_CASE;

Indent blocks of code, int main should have one indent and then more indents for any methods/functions, etc.

Commenting Code:
a. Use comments to describe what the program does.

b. Data tables, they should have the use of the variable. ex: int count // used to keep count of integers.

c. Describe what each section is doing, input, processing, output. ex: //INPUT - Grabbing integer from the user.

d. Describe any very complex parts of code.

e. Class header/Author box on top of source code, providing relevant information.

ex:

PROJECT : Project Name

CLASS : CS1D

SECTION : MW: 2:30pm - 5:00pm

DUE DATE : 01/01/01

*****************************************************************/

Commenting Program Description:
a. Program Title

b. General Description

c. Describe IN & OUT variables/constants

ex:

//input - used to get input name from user

//AR_SIZE - the size of the array

int main():

a. Main should have constants above any declarations.

b. Variables come next with a brief description.

c. Initialization of variables.

d. In/Out/Processing: Details of what is going on in each significant section.

e. Double-space each code segment.

Initialization

a. Initialization should happen during or after declarations for the sake of consistency. ex:

int count; OR int count = 0;

count = 0;

Additional Rules:

a. NO GLOBAL VARIABLES! Very bad practice!

b. Use namespaces to declare identifiers with namespace scope.

c. Capitalize the class names.

d. Classes and methods/functions should have clear descriptions with pre and post-conditions.

Rules
Bi-weekly meetings (in person, via text or email) user should look at style guide and understand their story before beginning to code
When a story is done or about to be started user must notify the team
Don't be afraid to ask for help
If a user starts a story and feels that they are not capable of delivering, then they should notify team after they have given it an honest attempt(at least spend a day on it)
If the user is overwhelmed or needs help starting he/she should notify the team.
If a personal circumstance beyond their control happens, user should notify the team.
